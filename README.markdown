# // bling lord


## what

**ILLBlingLord** is an iOS springboard view controller class (yâ€™know, it looks like the iPhone/iPad home screen).  Setup is pretty easy.  See below.




## how

```objective-c
vc1 = [[MyFacebookViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MyFacebookViewController" bundle:nil];
vc2 = [[MyTwitterViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MyTwitterViewController" bundle:nil];
// create or reference more view controllers here
// ... also be sure to extend your view controllers from ILLBlingLordViewController
    
NSString *facebookIconPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource: @"facebook" ofType: @"png"]; // @@TODO: refactor to framework style
UIImage *facebookIcon = [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile: iconPath];

NSString *twitterIconPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource: @"twitter" ofType: @"png"]; // @@TODO: refactor to framework style
UIImage *twitterIcon = [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile: iconPath];

// create an array of ILLBlingLordMenuItem objects
NSMutableArray *items = [NSMutableArray array];

// these first two menu items automatically push the user to the specified view controller when they're tapped
[items addObject:[ILLBlingLordMenuItem initWithTitle:@"facebook" image:facebookIcon removable:YES viewController:vc1]];
[items addObject:[ILLBlingLordMenuItem initWithTitle:@"twitter" image:twitterIcon removable:NO viewController:vc2]];

// this menu item executes a block when it's tapped
[items addObject:[ILLBlingLordMenuItem initWithTitle: @"twitter"
                                               image: twitterIcon
                                           removable: NO
                                     tapHandlerBlock: ^{
                                       UIAlertView *someStupidAlert = ...
                                       // ... etc.
                                       // note that the block is a simple dispatch_block_t,
                                       // i.e., it takes no params and returns void.
                                     }]];
// ... etc
    
// pass the array to a newly created ILLBlingLord and add it to your view
// ... but for the love of god, please don't use [UIImage imageNamed:]
ILLBlingLord *board = [ILLBlingLord initWithTitle:@"Welcome" items:items launcherImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"navbtn_home.png"]];
[self.view addSubview:board];
```




## customization

### automatic navigation bar on/off

if you don't want the navbar, pass `nil` as the title parameter to **ILLBlingLord**'s init method, like so:

```objective-c
ILLBlingLord *board = [ILLBlingLord initWithTitle:nil items:items launcherImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"navbtn_home.png"]];
```

more to come, perhaps.
